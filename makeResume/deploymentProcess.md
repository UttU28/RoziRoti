AZURE ACTIVE DIRECTORY (Azure AD)

Deployment Process in CI/CD Pipeline
Terraform Plan and Apply:
    The pipeline starts with terraform plan to review changes related to Azure AD resources. After approval, terraform apply is executed to create users, groups, roles, and service principals.
    Terraform state is managed and stored securely, often in Azure Blob Storage with access keys stored in Azure Key Vault.

User and Group Configuration:
    Users and groups are created and managed via Terraform scripts or directly through the Azure AD portal.
    Assign roles and permissions to ensure appropriate access levels for different users and groups.

Application Registration:
    Register applications in Azure AD to enable SSO and API access. Configure redirect URIs, certificates, and client secrets as part of the deployment process.
    Use managed identities where possible to avoid managing credentials manually.

RBAC and Conditional Access:
    Define and apply RBAC roles using Terraform or Azure CLI. Ensure that roles are assigned based on the principle of least privilege.
    Configure conditional access policies to enforce security requirements, such as MFA and device compliance, based on organizational policies.

## **Integration with Other Services**:
- **Ansible**: Use Azure AD service principals for authenticating and managing Azure resources in Ansible playbooks.
- **ACR and AKS**: Configure service principals or managed identities to enable secure access to ACR and AKS. Ensure that AKS clusters are set up to use Azure AD for RBAC and secure access to the Kubernetes API.
- **Docker**: Secure Docker registry access with Azure AD, using service principals for authentication in CI/CD pipelines.

By integrating Azure AD into the pipeline, you ensure secure, centralized identity and access management, streamline user and application access, and enhance compliance with security policies. Azure ADâ€™s role in managing authentication and authorization is crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient cloud infrastructure.
