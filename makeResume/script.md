## **Kaun Hai Tu?**
- I am **Utsav Chaudhary**, I have around **4.5 years** of Experience in **Cloud Automation** and **DevOps**, I'm **currently** working with **TransAmerica** as my **client**.  

## **Kya kaam karta hai TransAmerica me?**
- In TransAmerica I am hired as **Cloud DevOps Engineer** in the **Infrastructure Team** and **my role** here is to **Migrate On-Premise** applications to **Azure Cloud** using **Azure Services**, where we **Architected and Implemented** scalable cloud infrastructure leveraging Azure's robust offerings such as Virtual Networks (VNets), Azure Storage solutions including Blob Storage and SQL Database, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for container orchestration. The Migration strategy we used is **Refactor [Re-Architecture]** approach where all the Applications that needes to be migrated are to be **Re-Architectured** to maximise the utilization of **Cloud Services** like Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Service Bus for communication.  
- I implemented **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) using **Terraform** and Azure Resource Manager (**ARM**) **templates** to automate the **provisioning and management** of cloud resources and also wrote some **Ansible** scripts for **Configuration management** of the deployed resources.  
- Used **Azure VPN** and **ExpressRoute** for setting **secure** and **seamless** access to **On-Premise Data**.  
- **Optimized** application **performance** and reliability by **implementing** comprehensive **CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps**. These pipelines are intricately designed to **Automate -> build, test, and deployment** processes across **Dev, Test, QAT, and Prod** environments, using **Azure Repos** for **source code management** and **version control**. Incorporated **security** and **quality** tools like **SonarCube, Synk, CheckMarx, OWASP ZAP** in the pipeline. **Created** pipelines for **Unit Testing, Integration Testing, UI Testing, and Performance Testing**.  
- Additionally, I utilized **Docker** for **containerization** by creating **scalable** and **reusable** **IMAGES of** the required Code, Configuration and Dependencies. Used **Azure Container Registry** for **storing** these **images** which gives **Version Control** and **Artifacts Management**. Then I used **Kubernetes** on **AKS** to **orchestrate** these **containers**, ensuring efficient **resource utilization, automatic scaling, and high availability** of applications. By integrating Docker and Kubernetes into the deployment pipeline, I **enable rapid, reliable, and consistent application delivery** across multiple environments, **enhancing** the **robustness** of our **cloud infrastructure**.  
- Additionally, I use **Azure Boards** to **manage** work items, **track** progress, ensuring continuous integration and continuous delivery (**CI/CD**) by **following agile** methodologies.
